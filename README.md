GAN (Generative adversarial network) Image Generator

Generative modeling is an unsupervised learning task in machine learning that involves automatically discovering and learning the regularities or patterns in input data in such a way that the model can be used to generate or output new examples that plausibly could have been drawn from the original dataset.

GAN is a setup of two networks, a generator network, and a discriminator network. These two networks can be neural networks, ranging from convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks to auto-encoders.
